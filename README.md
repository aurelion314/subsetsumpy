# subsetsumpy
code to solve the subset sum problem

## usage
Fill in the array starting_nums with the set of numbers from which we are working

Set the required sum in the variable goal_summ

Run it!


Note: This will always find a solution if there is one, but if there are many solutions, it may not always find every available combination (For most practical cases it does though).
